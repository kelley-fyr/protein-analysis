# protein-analysis
### Goal: to develop an easy-to-use, flexible protein analysis tool for use at FYR
#### 2025-10-03
- Started from a massive R script I made with ChatGPT to process the NeuroOnc Mass Spec data.
  - it consists of 11 sections that each perform a specific analysis
  - but these sections need to be cleaned up and shortened/merged with other sections
  - also need to start working on building in flexibility to analyze different datasets different ways
